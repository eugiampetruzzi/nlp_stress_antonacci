Standardized Prompt for Secure GPT-4o Data Cleaning

The below prompt was used to correct occasional speaker label errors generated by PyAnnote. This post hoc text-only relabeling step was performed using a secure, intuitionally compliant GPT-4o deployment (https://securegpt.stanfordhealthcare.org/) configured for PHI with no external data retention. The model inferred speaker roles from lexical cues and turn-taking patterns and did not alter transcript content. Corrected speaker labels were used to remove interviewer speech. Given the input token limit, transcripts were input in 150-line chunks.

// New chat for each subject //

You are provided with a diarized transcript of a clinical interview below. Each line contains the following:

1. start time,

2. stop time,

3. speaker label (e.g., SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01), and

4. transcribed text.

The transcription was generated with WhisperX and is generally accurate, but the speaker assignments are often incorrect. Your task is to revise the speaker labels based on contextual language cues, so that the resulting transcript reflects accurate speaker turns between the interviewer and participant.

Instructions:
•	Use the content and flow of the conversation to infer correct speaker changes (e.g., question vs answer, first-person vs second-person pronouns, discourse markers).
•	DO NOT ALTER THE TRANSCRIPTION TEXT OR TIMESTAMPS—only correct speaker labels.
•	Assume that there are only two speakers throughout: Interviewer and Participant. Assign these labels consistently.
•	Ensure that every line of the input appears exactly once in the output, with only the speaker label corrected. Do not remove or duplicate lines.
•	Return the corrected transcript in the same structure as the input file, replacing misassigned speaker labels with the correct ones. 
•	Only output the corrected transcript—do not add explanations, summaries, or extra text. Also return the complete transcript; do not stop early.

Let me know if this makes sense, and I will paste in the transcript.
